Skin Scan: An Android Based Mobile Application for Skin lesions Detection using Alex Net*
We’ll see how a simple automated system can help people easily diagnose skin conditions and act on them to avoid wasting their health and money. Android phones are now affordable 
and accessible to low income groups. This system can help people easily diagnose skin lesions and act appropriately to keep away from wasting their health and money. The objective
of this project is to create an Android application capable of detecting skin lesions using images captured by a smartphone camera. This will empower consumers and allow them to have
better preventive approaches for skin lesions . Research works in advance identification of skin lesions have been done and numerous experimenters have approached varied ways to identify skin lesions. Deep learning, Convolutional learning, and
Neural Learning are some of the ways being used to attempt to answer the complication [ 2 ]. The underlying technology used in TensorFlow is Google’s open source software library
for machine learning. The tool is designed such that it can run on mobile devices with minimal hardware requirements. Skin Scan can be used for the detection of skin lesions from images captured with a mobile device’s camera and provide users with a diagnosis results. The project aims to build a convenient
Mobile application called “Skin Scan” which detects skin lesions from images captured by a mobile device, and provides information about possible treatments for the user. We will also
create an extension that lets users take pictures of their own gallery , so that they can receive personalized analysis reports on their skin signs. As the condition progresses, changes occur
on the skin; this includes variation in colour and size [4]. With deep convolutional neural networks. We can train the model and generate a model to identify skin lesions. With the app,
users capture skin images with any medium-quality mobile camera. The photo is then processed and Then the integrated algorithm is compared to detect the lesions and provide online
solutions based on the skin lesion. Hence, users can cultivate time and money in addition to their health through figuring out their troubles early.
